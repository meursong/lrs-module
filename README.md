# xAPI Module

** xAPI Module is a lightweight and modular library for creating xAPI-compliant statements in Java-based projects. It simplifies the process of generating xAPI statements while adhering to the xAPI (Experience API) specification. This library does not include Learning Record Store (LRS) integration, focusing instead on statement creation.
